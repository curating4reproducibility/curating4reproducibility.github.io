        <description>CURE is more than data curation. The object of curation in the context of reproducibility is the evidence-base for the scientific claim. This requires consideration of not only the artifacts that underlie reported findings, but also the research workflows that led to the creation of those artifacts that produced the the findings.
CURE applies curation actions to the entire research compendium. The research compendium is a file bundle that contains the data, code, documentation, and all other materials needed to repeat the computational workflow to produce results identical to those presented in the published article without the need to request additional information from the author.</description>
