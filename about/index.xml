This requires consideration of not only the artifacts that underlie reported findings, but also the research workflows that led to the creation of those artifacts that produced the the findings.
CURE applies curation actions to the entire research compendium # The research compendium is a file bundle that contains the data, code, documentation, and all other materials needed to repeat the computational workflow to produce results identical to those presented in the published article without the need to request additional information from the author.</description></item><item><title>Community</title><link>https://curating4reproducibility.org/about/community/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 04:42:44 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://curating4reproducibility.org/about/community/</guid><description>Community information here.</description></item><item><title>Report</title><link>https://curating4reproducibility.org/about/report/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 04:42:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://curating4reproducibility.org/about/report/</guid><description>Links to downloadable annual reports.</description></item></channel></rss>
