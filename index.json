Computational reproducibility is a means of making scientific claims more transparent. It is imperative for verifying and building upon reported findings, preserving a complete scientific record, and enhancing pedagogical strategies for research methods training. For various reasons, the computational reproducibility standard has not been adopted as an integral part of normative scientific practice.\nComputational reproducibility involves the assembly of a “reproducibility file bundle” or “research compendium” that includes all of the research artifacts (e.g., data, code, documentation) necessary for the computation. Prior to publishing or archiving the research compendium, the objects contained within require curation to ensure they meet quality standards for computational reproducibility.\nThe object of curation in the context of reproducibility is the scientific claim: We are curating the digital artifacts that underlie the claim. \nCuration for FAIR and reproducible research is the process of reviewing and enhancing a research compendium for long term reuse.\nWe curate to: a) assess whether computational reproducibility can be achieved using the digital artifacts contained within the research compendium, and b) ensure that the quality of the digital artifacts aligns with the FAIR principles and community standards for long-term archival preservation.\nBoth activities are essential aspects of curation in the context of reproducible research. We call these practices Curation for FAIR and Reproducible Research, or CURE-FAIR.\nCuration is often carried out near the end of the research lifecycle by data and archive professionals who may also be subject matter experts. However, there are many data and code management actions that other key stakeholders can take earlier in the lifecycle to facilitate the production of FAIR and computationally reproducible research compendia.\nCurators can be viewed as the first reusers of the research compendium. Prior to publication or archiving, curators can flag issues with a research compendium that preclude computational reproducibility, then take actions to remedy problems or recommend an appropriate course of action. For example, curators can make sure that software configuration and dependency information is well-documented so that an independent researcher can recreate the computational environment with the proper technical specifications.\nThis document includes standards-based guidelines for CURE-FAIR best practices in archiving and publishing computationally reproducible studies that rely on quantitative data, primarily in the social sciences. Our hope is that these \u0026ldquo;10 Things for Curating Reproducible and FAIR Research\u0026rdquo; will serve as a starting point for the development of curatorial guidelines to extend beyond the specific concerns of the social sciences community and other domains and disciplines that use similar methods, and to the particular curatorial concerns and requirements of an archives or publisher.\nComputational reproducibility requires a village. This document is primarily for data curators and information professionals who are charged with verifying that a computation can be executed and that it can reproduce prespecified results. Secondarily, it will be of interest to researchers, publishers, editors, reviewers, and others who have a stake in creating, using, sharing, publishing, or preserving reproducible research.\n","description":"Introduction to the 10 Things for Curating Reproducible and FAIR Research","id":13,"section":"10things","tags":null,"title":"Introduction","uri":"https://curating4reproducibility.org/10things/intro/"},{"content":"Related FAIR Principles: R1, R1.2, R1.3\nA research compendium contains all of the objects required to reproduce a predefined output. When curation includes reproducing scientific claims or findings, you will need to check that all of the requisite objects and information are included in the research compendium. This often includes data, code, outputs, a codebook or data dictionary, and supporting documentation.\nCompleteness ensures re-users of the research compendium are well-informed and have the context necessary to reproduce the results without needing to contact the original producer or track down missing components.\n  Get Started  When preparing a research compendium for reproducibility and curation, the goal should be to include all pertinent information, documentation, and files necessary to successfully run and recreate research output(s). Consider the following questions about each compendium component: Data\n If specific input data are necessary to reproduce a prespecified outcome, are the data included as a separate digital object? If not, has detailed information been provided on where and how to obtain the specific input data, or how to generate them? Are the data sensitive or restricted by the data producer? Is there enough information within the compendium to allow re-users to find and request access to these data? If input data are available from an external source, is there some promise of permanence? If there is a chance the data will change over time, will re-users be able to access or recreate the version of data used in this study?  Code\n Are computing instructions included as digital objects in the research compendium? How are these computing instructions represented (e.g., personal scripts, bespoke manual steps, archived source code repository, a fully automated workflow available via open software libraries)? What environment, including hardware and software, does the computation rely on, and are all the packages specified?  Output\n Does the compendium include an output as a separate digital object? What is the nature of the output in relation to the other objects in the compendium (i.e., is it a log from a statistical program, an executable paper, new data, new file, table, figure)? Documentation Does the compendium include a codebook or data dictionary that defines the contents of the data file? Are variable definitions clear? Are units of measure included where appropriate? Does the compendium include a README file that outlines the contents of the compendium and the relationships among them?  Container\n If the data or other objects are not in the container, are there precise instructions for accessing them during computation? Does the container require separate maintenance? Under what conditions will the container open?      Learn More  A research compendium should be able to stand on its own, with little interaction between a compendium producer and a re-user. Once deposited into a repository, the compendium should be accessible and reusable. More information on constructing a robust compendium can be found in Thing 5: Documentation and Thing 6: Access. Academics have been describing research compendiums and the necessary components that comprise a robust compendium for a few years now. Learn more about these recommendations below:\n Sandve, G. K., Nekrutenko, A., Taylor, J., \u0026amp; Hovig, E. (2013). Ten simple rules for reproducible computational research. PLoS Computational Biology, 9(10), e1003285. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285\nThe authors present a simple set of rules that can be used to make research more reproducible by enacting changes within your own research habits. Berenson, K. R. (2017). Managing your research data and documentation. American Psychological Association. https://www.apa.org/pubs/books/4313048\nIn this book, Berenson outlines and describes how to construct a research compendium with reproducibility in mind. Krafczyk, M. S., Shi, A., Bhaskar, A., Marinov, D., \u0026amp; Stodden, V. (2021). Learning from reproducing computational results: introducing three principles and the Reproduction Package. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 379(2197), 20200069. https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2020.0069\nThis article takes a slightly different approach of investigating the reproducibility of seven different articles. After performing their checks, the authors developed three principles for making research more reproducible based on the roadblocks they encountered in their own attempts at computation reproducibility.

The above steps enable Unicode Standard emoji characters and sequences in Hugo, however the rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform. To style the emoji you can either use a third party emoji font or a font stack; e.g.\n1 2 3  .emoji { font-family: Apple Color Emoji,Segoe UI Emoji,NotoColorEmoji,Segoe UI Symbol,Android Emoji,EmojiSymbols; }  ","description":"","id":35,"section":"blog","tags":["emoji"],"title":"Emoji Support","uri":"https://curating4reproducibility.org/blog/emoji-support/"},{"content":" CURE is more than data curation. The object of curation in the context of reproducibility is the evidence-base for the scientific claim. This requires consideration of not only the artifacts that underlie reported findings, but also the research workflows that led to the creation of those artifacts that produced the the findings.\nCURE applies curation actions to the entire research compendium. The research compendium is a file bundle that contains the data, code, documentation, and all other materials needed to repeat the computational workflow to produce results identical to those presented in the published article without the need to request additional information from the author. This insistence on independent understandability is emphasized by the concept of “intelligent openness” and in the OAIS Reference Model whereby digital objects must be “independently understandable to (and usable by) the Designated Community…without needing the assistance of the experts who produced the information.”\nCURE demands a series of rigorous curation activities. CURE practices can ensure that the research compendium and its component objects align with prevailing prevailing community standards for digital archiving and preservation and support the FAIR principles to create a complete and reproducible scholarly record. CURE is based on the Data Quality Review Framework, which describes a comprehensive set of curation actions not only for file, document, and data review, but also for code review.\n","description":"The CURE approach to curating research artifacts","id":37,"section":"about","tags":null,"title":"CURE Approach","uri":"https://curating4reproducibility.org/about/approach/"}]
