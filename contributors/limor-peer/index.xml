      <description>Limor Peer, Thu-Mai Christian, Florio Arguillas, and Joshua Dull hosted a CURE workshop at the IASSIST 2017 conference in Lawrence, Kansas on May 23, 2017.
The workshop titled, &amp;ldquo;Curating for Reproducibility: Why and How to Review Data and Code,&amp;rdquo; offered participants practical strategies for curating research materials for reproducibility through examples and hands-on activities.
These strategies are based on the Data Quality Review, a framework for helping ensure that research data are well documented and usable and that code executes properly and reproduces analytic results.</description>
