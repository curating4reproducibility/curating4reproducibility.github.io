      <description>CCSS: Results Reproduction (R-squared) Service # The Cornell Center for Social Sciences (CCSS) (formerly known as the Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research, or CISER), founded in 1981, is home to one of the oldest university-based social science data archives in the United States. CCSS&amp;rsquo;s mission is to accelerate, enhance, and amplify social science research at Cornell.
CCSS offers the Results Reproduction Service (R-squared), which ensures that published research results are computationally repoducible, and that the data and code underlying the results are well-documented, reusable, and preserved in a trustworthy repository.</description>

      <description>Empirical claims reported in a scientific journal typically rest upon data, software, code, documentation, and other digital artifacts that together constitute a “research compendium” (Gentleman &amp;amp; Lang, 2004). The ability to independently reproduce scientific findings based on computational methods as reported by the original author is imperative (NASEM, 2019). It allows confirmation of the research processes described by the original author and verification of the findings presented in the scientific publication.</description>
