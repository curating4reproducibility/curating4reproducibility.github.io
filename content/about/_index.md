The Curating for Reproducibility Consortium was established to promote curation practices that ensure that research compendia and their component artifacts constitute a complete and reproducible scholarly record. Our goal is to establish standards, share practices, and promote the Data Quality Review framework for rigorous curation workflows that support computational reproducibility of published scientific findings.
