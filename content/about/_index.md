**The Curating for Reproducibility Consortium was established to promote curation practices that ensure that research compendia and their component artifacts constitute a complete and reproducible scholarly record. Our goal is to establish standards, share practices, and promote the [Data Quality Review](dqr) framework for rigorous curation workflows that support computational reproducibility of published scientific findings.**

**Establishing Standards.** Building on existing and evolving standards, CURE is dedicated to establishing and communicating the driving principles and criteria for proper curation for reproducibility.

**Sharing Practices.** Curating for reproducibility involves multiple tasks and several stakeholders. A primary goal of CURE is to map the vital elements of the workflow, and to share the best practices that have emerged within each organization.

**Promoting Data Quality Review.** CURE members believe that pre-publication data quality review is essential for the progression of science and preservation of knowledge.
