Limor Peer, Thu-Mai Christian, Florio Arguillas, and Joshua Dull hosted a CURE workshop at the IASSIST 2017 conference in Lawrence, Kansas on May 23, 2017.

The workshop titled, "Curating for Reproducibility: Why and How to Review Data and Code," offered participants practical strategies for curating research materials for reproducibility through examples and hands-on activities. 

These strategies are based on the [Data Quality Review](/resources/dqr/), a framework for helping ensure that research data are well documented and usable and that code executes properly and reproduces analytic results. 

The workshop also introduced three models for putting this framework into practice (the Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS) at Yale University, the Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research (CISER), and the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).Â  In addition, the workshop introduced the Yale Application for Research Data (YARD), a tool that structures the CURE workflow.
