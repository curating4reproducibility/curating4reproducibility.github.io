The CURE team will be hosting a half-day workshop at the [13th International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC)](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc18) in Barcelona on February 19, 2018 from 9:30 to 12:30.Â 

The workshop, "**Curating for Reproducibility: Producing High Quality Data and Code for Transparent and Reproducible Research**," will teach participants practical strategies for curating research materials to support reproducible science.

The workshop will be based on the Data Quality Review, a framework for helping ensure that research data are well documented and usable, and that code executes properly and reproduces analytic results.
