description: "Computational reproducibility requires a village. This document is primarily for data curators and information professionals who are charged with verifying that a computation can be executed and can reproduce prespecified results. Secondarily, it is for researchers, publishers, editors, reviewers, and others who have a stake in creating, using, sharing, publishing, or preserving reproducible research."
