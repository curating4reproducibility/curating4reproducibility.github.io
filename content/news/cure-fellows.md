#### About the Data CuRe Fellowship
The Data CuRe Fellowship program provides professional development, education, and training opportunities in data curation and code review in support of raising awareness and building capacity for sound practices of curating for reproducibility. During the 1-year term of the CuRe Fellowship program, Fellows will have responsibilities in the following three areas:

**Incorporating Data CuRe practices.** Data CuRe principals will mentor the Fellows and account for their particular circumstances. Each Fellow will develop and implement a plan for incorporating Data CuRe practices in their daily work. This can include implementation of Data CuRe practices by individuals or small groups, the introduction of a new service on campus, building upon current services, and more.

**Engaging in the development, dissemination, and evaluation of the Data CuRe curriculum.** In close communication with Data CuRe principals, Fellows are expected to actively engage in the development and implementation of the Data CuRe curriculum, including using the Library Carpentry platform. 

**Attending a professional conference related to Data CuRe.** Fellows are expected to participate in a professional conference or event relevant to Data CuRe, as an opportunity for professional development and engagement with the topic. Other activities may be also considered as long as they promote curating for reproducibility. These activities may take on different forms, and may be carried out either independently or in collaboration with other Fellows and associates of Data CuRe.
