title: "Thing 10: Periodic Review"
description: "The idea here is that digital curation is an ongoing activity. A “series of managed activities necessary to ensure continued access to digital materials for as long as necessary” is the essence of digital preservation. As a curator, you will need to perform periodic reviews, ideally in a scheduled and automated way, and remediate if need be."
