description: "Provenance is a fundamental archiving principle that refers to information about the origins, chain of custody, and ownership of an object, which helps to establish the objectâ€™s authenticity and authority.  In the context of research compendium components, knowledge about their sources, creation, and transformation over time is critical to assessing the quality, reliability, and trustworthiness of the compendium as well as the research outputs it serves to substantiate."
