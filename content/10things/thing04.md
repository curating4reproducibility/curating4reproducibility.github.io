title: "Thing 4: Transparency"
description: "Transparency is a precondition of computational reproducibility. The inability to reproduce results is often caused by missing or insufficient information about the knowledge production process: where and how the data were obtained or generated, the analytical steps taken to produce results, the technical specifications of the requisite computing environment, the scripts used to process or manipulate the data, and any other information (often taking the form of tacit knowledge) needed to understand and re-execute the analysis. Despite lengthy methods sections in scholarly journal articles, many of these critical “backstage” details are either not included or not within easy reach. This problem of opaque, or “black box,” research can undermine the integrity of the scientific record when no individual besides the original investigator is able to undertake the analysis process to reproduce the reported findings."
