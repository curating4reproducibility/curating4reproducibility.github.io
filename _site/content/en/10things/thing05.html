<p>An important strategy for demonstrating research transparency is to create comprehensive
documentation that captures important details of the research process so that others are able to follow it to reproduce published research results. Failing to record essential information about the research compendium—descriptions of individual compendium files, technical requirements for using compendium files, the origin of materials used in secondary analyses, dataset variable and value code definitions, analytical steps for generating expected results—relegates the research process to a “black box,” making it difficult or even impossible to reproduce results.</p>

<p><strong>Robust documentation is the outcome of an intentional practice that keeps in mind the information needs of the compendium re-user so that the research compendium and the materials contained within it are <em>independently understandable for informed reuse</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Documentation can take on various forms. Common examples are README files, data availability statements, data dictionaries or codebooks, and code headers and non-executable comments. However the information about compendium components and the analysis workflow is presented, reproducibility relies on the presence of robust documentation that assumes no prior knowledge of the research process, thereby making the tacit more explicit.</p>

<h3 id="readme-file">README file</h3>

<p>When reviewing the contents of a research compendium, it should be clear the contents of each file, the purpose it serves, and citations to the original sources of extant materials. This information is often communicated in a README file that provides the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The purpose of the compendium</li>
  <li>Citation to the associated research publication</li>
  <li>List of files with descriptions of each file</li>
  <li>Citations to original sources of materials used in secondary analyses</li>
  <li>Operating system and software requirements including version information</li>
  <li>Specific step-by-step instructions on how to install, execute, and/or implement components of the compendium to reproduce expected results</li>
  <li>Licensing information that establishes acceptable uses of the materials</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="data-availability-statement">Data availability statement</h3>

<p>Especially for data and other research artifacts that cannot be made publicly available, it is important to provide information on where and how to access the files in a data availability statement. This document should contain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Formal data citation that, if available, includes a persistent identifier (e.g., DOI) or other stable URL</li>
  <li>Instructions on where and how to access the materials (e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.25490/a97f-egyk">Data Citation Principles</a>, <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/addtl-data-citation-guidance.html">Guidance on Data Citations</a>)</li>
  <li>Any specific protocols required to access the materials (e.g., IRB approval, data use agreement)</li>
  <li>Duration of any embargo placed on the materials</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="codebook">Codebook</h3>

<p>A codebook, also referred to as a data dictionary, gives meaning to each variable and value that appears in a dataset. For every dataset in the compendium, a codebook should define each variable by providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Variable names and human-readable variable labels</li>
  <li>Value codes and human-readable value labels for categorical and dichotomous variables</li>
  <li>Variable formats (e.g., string, numeric, date)</li>
  <li>Missing value codes</li>
  <li>Functions or expressions used to generate constructed or derived variables</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="code-headers-and-comments">Code headers and comments</h3>

<p>Besides the scripts that execute the analysis workflow, code files should also include header information that identifies the associated study and technical specifications for executing the code, as well as non-executable comments that explain the analysis process. Specifically, code files should contain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Citation to the associated research publication</li>
  <li>Primary author name and contact information</li>
  <li>Operating system, software, and package dependencies including version information (this may be generated using a software command such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print sessionInfo</code> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sessioninfo/index.html">in R</a> or included in a requirements.txt file)</li>
  <li>Character encoding</li>
  <li>Date of most recent code update</li>
  <li>Date of most recent code execution</li>
  <li>Code license (See <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/solving-license-compliance-at-the-source-adding-spdx-license-ids/">embedded SPDX license</a> terms)</li>
  <li>Non-executable, human-readable comments explaining the function of scripts and how they map to results presented in the publication</li>
</ul>
