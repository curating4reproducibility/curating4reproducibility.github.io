<p>When curating a reproducible file bundle, consider any extraneous parts that can be cut to make the overall bundle simpler to streamline computational reproduction.</p>

<p><strong>Economizing everything means fewer research objects can break while also requiring less care and maintenance over time.</strong></p>

<p>Simplifying and commenting out code are a couple of methods for tackling economization; however, the approach may vary depending on the type of software or methods being used for analysis. During file review and/or curation, here are some questions to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can the scripts be simplified by removing redundancies or using loops and functions, for example?</li>
  <li>Are code blocks ordered logically according to the presentation of the results in the publication?</li>
  <li>Is there a master script that groups together all the other scripts? Are there additional scripts outside the master script and if so, are they necessary?</li>
  <li>Are the dependencies to the scripts or code all necessary?</li>
  <li>Are there comments in the code to help understand the computational workflow?</li>
  <li>Are there notebooks?</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned previously, the approach to economizing code is dependent upon many factors. Here are resources specific to a few disciplines that highlight some best practices:</p>
