<p>Transparency is a precondition of computational reproducibility. Ideally, the research compendium provides full disclosure of the research process that produced the scientific claim.</p>

<p>The inability to reproduce results is often caused by missing or insufficient information about the knowledge production process: where and how the data were obtained or generated, the analytical steps taken to produce results, the technical specifications of the requisite computing environment, the scripts used to process or manipulate the data, and any other information (often taking the form of tacit knowledge) needed to understand and re-execute the analysis. Despite lengthy methods sections in scholarly journal articles, many of these critical “backstage” details are either not included or not within easy reach. This problem of such opaque, or “black box,” research can undermine the integrity of the scientific record when no individual besides the original investigator is able to undertake the analysis process to verify the reported findings.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency requires that details about how the data were captured and transformed, and how they were analyzed to produce published results are included in the research compendium.</strong></p>

<p>Think about a re-user of the research compendium and the specific information they would need in order to re-execute the analysis to generate expected results. Consider the questions below for each key aspect of research transparency.</p>

<h3 id="access-transparency">Access transparency</h3>

<p>Access transparency requires that re-users of the research compendium are provided specific information about the location of the materials, protocols for accessing them, and their origin (i.e., provenance).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are explicit instructions provided on where and how to request and access materials not included in the compendium? If they cannot be made publicly available due to licensing or sensitive data restrictions, is this detail included?</li>
  <li>For research that involves secondary analysis of extant data or uses existing code, are original sources cited with a persistent identifier or stable URL that resolves to the specific data files used in the analysis?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="production-transparency">Production transparency</h3>

<p>Production transparency is evident when details about the study design and research methods (e.g., sampling frameworks, response rates, validity testing) are clearly articulated.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are key aspects of the research design and analytic methods disclosed to allow for understanding and evaluation of the research process?</li>
  <li>Is information on how data were selected, captured, transformed, and analyzed provided in adequate detail to understand the choices made and steps taken by the researcher?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="analytic-transparency">Analytic Transparency</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Are the technical specifications of the computing environment, including operating system, software, and packages requirements (and their versions), provided?</li>
  <li>Is the process used to transform raw or original data into the analysis dataset made evident in the script files?</li>
  <li>Do script files contain non-executable comments that explain the purpose of codeblocks to enhance human readability of the analytical workflow?</li>
</ul>

<p>Many scholars have been advancing the cause of transparency by highlighting its positive impact on scientific rigor and integrity while also describing the adverse effects of research that fails to disclose the processes that underpinned the results. Read the articles below to further understand the impetus for increasing transparency as a means to promote research reproducibility.</p>
