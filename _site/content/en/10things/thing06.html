<p>Science is a community endeavor that sees maximum benefits when the materials produced in the course of research activities are made maximally available to community members to enable them to build upon, reuse, and verify scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>Fortunately, trustworthy repositories exist to preserve research artifacts for long-term discovery, access, and use. Trustworthy repositories are equipped with the policies, infrastructure, expertise, and workflows that ensure research compendia submitted to the repository are made publicly available alongside human- and machine-readable information (i.e, metadata) to facilitate access and use.</p>

<p>Ideally, the research compendium and the objects contained within it would be made as open as possible by placing the compendium in the public domain, which would permit anyone to freely use, modify, and redistribute the materials for any purpose. However, ethical and/or legal constraints may make it necessary to define and enforce acceptable uses of the research compendium or any of its component parts. This is best accomplished by assigning a formal license to the materials.</p>

<p>In addition to physical and legal access to the compendium, access is concerned with access to the technology and tools necessary to use the compendium. Requiring the use of costly, proprietary, obscure, or obsolete hardware or software to render compendium files, for example, impedes efforts to reproduce research results.</p>

<p><strong>Because the research compendium serves as the evidence-base for published findings, enabling others to access it with minimal physical, legal, and technical barriers is essential for supporting and promoting computational reproducibility.</strong></p>

<h3 id="physical-access">Physical access</h3>

<p>Access to the compendium and its components is best preserved when placed in a trustworthy repository. When considering physical access to a compendium, address the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the research compendium (and all of its component parts) made available in a trustworthy repository that provides long-term archival access to materials without undue burden?</li>
  <li>Is the research compendium assigned a digital object identifier (DOI) or other unique, persistent identifier that allows web access to the compendium, even if its online location should change?</li>
  <li>Is standardized metadata included with compendium materials to facilitate discovery, access, and use of the compendium?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="legal-access">Legal access</h3>

<p>Whether a research compendium is placed in the public domain or has use restrictions applied, acceptable and/or conditional uses of the compendium and its individual contents should be declared using precise language in the form of a waiver or machine-readable license that addresses the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are there any compelling reasons that the compendium cannot be placed in the public domain to maximize access?</li>
  <li>If access to the materials must be restricted, who is permitted to request access?</li>
  <li>For what purposes may the materials be used?</li>
  <li>What types of uses of the materials are prohibited (e.g., commercial uses, modification, redistribution)?</li>
  <li>What are the specific protocols (if any) that one must follow to access and use the materials (e.g., IRB approval, use of a secure computing workstation)?</li>
  <li>What obligations must be fulfilled as conditions for accessing and using the materials (e.g., data citation, funder statement)?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-access">Technical access</h3>

<p>As much as possible, the technology (i.e., hardware and software) required to render and use compendium files to reproduce the associated published results should be reasonably accessible by scholars for whom the research is relevant. Determine if this is the case by addressing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is required software open-source or in common use by the research community?</li>
  <li>Is comprehensive, up-to-date documentation available to facilitate use of the technology?</li>
  <li>Does the technology have longevity, i.e, is it unlikely that the technology will become obsolete in the near future, making it unusable?</li>
  <li>Are there alternatives that would be suitable for rendering and using compendium files should the technology become difficult or impossible to access? In other words, are file formats hardware-, operating system-, and software-agnostic?</li>
</ul>

<p>The resources below offer a closer look at mechanisms for supporting physical, legal, and technical access to research compendium files as a means of promoting research reproducibility.</p>

<p>While Open Science is the goal, there are instances in which access and use of materials must be restricted due to their sensitive nature. Datasets that contain personal health information or other identifiable data collected from human participants, data collected with Indigenous partners, traditional knowledge, and precise location information of vulnerable species or protected sites often must be safeguarded against unauthorized access or disclosure.
