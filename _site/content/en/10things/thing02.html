<p>As research projects progress, they often evolve and things get more complicated and opaque over time; memory fails; project team members move on to new ventures. It is difficult to predict what may happen with a project down the line, so it is important to properly organize a compendium throughout the project itself.</p>

<p><strong>Organization is necessary to understand and to keep track of the various artifacts in the research compendium and the relationships among them over time.</strong></p>

<p>The organization of a research compendium depends on the types of files, their relationship to one another, as well as their interactions within the computational workflow. There is not a single, prescribed way for organizing research artifacts; however, these are some questions to consider as a project is being organized within a compendium:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How are the objects organized within the research compendium?</li>
  <li>Can you identify what each object is?</li>
  <li>Can you determine the function of each object in relation to each other?</li>
  <li>Are names of files indicative of their content?</li>
  <li>How is the compendium packaged?</li>
  <li>Is the folder structure logical, and does it enhance understanding of the computational workflow?</li>
  <li>Does the current structure permit streamlined reproducibility without errors?</li>
  <li>What if the objects cannot be organized in folders? What changes would you need to make to your scripts to incorporate a step to download (and perhaps unzip) the files prior to analysis and other steps?</li>
</ul>

<p>Enabling reuse may mean separately handling the “objects” of the reproducible file bundle. This may be true when curating a bundle where the data is available elsewhere. If the data are archived separately from the code, then an additional step will likely need to be incorporated into the processing scripts to fetch the data. While adding extra labor, there are several benefits to this approach. This means that subsequent work can call upon the same data, rather than redepositing the same data with different code.</p>
