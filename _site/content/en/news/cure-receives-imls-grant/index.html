<p>We are excited to announce that CURE has been awarded a grant from the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/available/laura-bush-21st-century-librarian-program">Laura Bush 21th Century Librarian Program</a>.
The grant will be used to support the development of an evidence-based training program for librarians and archivists focused on data curation for reproducibility.
The training program is intended to equip its participants with the skills needed to ensure the quality of research data, the demand for which has never been higher.
From the grant abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…the knowledge and skills necessary to perform rigorous data curation that includes a code review component—essential to research reproducibility—goes beyond the current expectations and abilities of most librarians and archivists. A continuing education program targeting academic librarians and data archivists would offer opportunities for practitioners to augment current expertise with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform intensive data curation tasks that support the research community’s demand for high quality data and code.</p>
